# Configuration Guide

Sussurro uses a flexible configuration system powered by [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper).

## Loading Mechanism

When Sussurro starts, it looks for a configuration file in the following order:

1.  **Command Line Flag**: If provided via `-config`.
    ```bash
    ./sussurro -config /path/to/my-config.yaml
    ```
2.  **Current Directory**: Checks for `config.yaml` in the directory where the binary is run.
3.  **Home Directory**: Checks for `~/.sussurro/config.yaml`.
4.  **Configs Directory**: Checks for `./configs/config.yaml`.
5.  **Fallback**: If `config.yaml` is not found, the same paths are checked for `default.yaml`.

## Configuration Structure (`config.yaml`)

The repo also includes `configs/default.yaml` with the same keys. It is a fallback if `config.yaml` is missing.

### App Settings
```yaml
app:
  name: "Sussurro"
  debug: true        # Enable verbose logging
  log_level: "info"  # debug, info, warn, error
```

### Audio Settings
```yaml
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000 # Required by Whisper
  channels: 1        # Mono audio
  bit_depth: 16
  buffer_size: 1024
  max_duration: "60s" # Maximum recording time (default: 60s, 0 for no limit)
```

### Model Settings
Sussurro requires two models: one for ASR and one for LLM cleanup.

```yaml
models:
  asr:
    path: "/home/you/.sussurro/models/ggml-small.bin"
    type: "whisper"
    threads: 4
    language: "en"   # BCP-47 code passed to Whisper; "auto" for auto-detection
  llm:
    path: "/home/you/.sussurro/models/qwen3-sussurro-q4_k_m.gguf" # Path to Qwen 3 model
    context_size: 32768                   # Qwen 3 supports large context
    gpu_layers: 0                         # Set > 0 if compiled with Metal or CUDA support
    threads: 4
```

Use absolute paths for model files. The first run setup writes a config file with absolute paths based on your home directory.

#### Whisper ASR Models

Two Whisper models are supported. During first-run setup you will be asked which one to download. You can also switch at any time:

```bash
sussurro --whisper   # or: sussurro --wsp
```

| Model | Filename | Size | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Whisper Small | `ggml-small.bin` | 488 MB | Faster, lower RAM |
| Whisper Large v3 Turbo | `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin` | 1.62 GB | Slower, higher accuracy |

The `--whisper` / `--wsp` flag opens an interactive menu, downloads the chosen model if needed, and updates `~/.sussurro/config.yaml` automatically.

#### Transcription language

The `language` key tells Whisper which language to expect. Use any [BCP-47 code supported by Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) (e.g. `"en"`, `"it"`, `"de"`, `"fr"`) or `"auto"` to let the model detect the language automatically. Defaults to `"en"`.

The value can be changed at any time from the **Settings → Transcription Language** dropdown; the new value is written to `~/.sussurro/config.yaml` immediately and takes effect on next launch. It can also be overridden via the environment:

```bash
export SUSSURRO_MODELS_ASR_LANGUAGE=it
```

### Hotkey Settings
```yaml
hotkey:
  trigger: "ctrl+shift+space" # The key combination to use for recording
  mode: "push-to-talk"        # "push-to-talk" or "toggle"
```

**`mode`** controls how the hotkey activates recording:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `push-to-talk` | Hold the hotkey to record; release to transcribe. |
| `toggle` | Press once to start recording; press again to transcribe. |

Defaults to `"push-to-talk"`. Can be changed from **Settings → Global Hotkey → Mode** and takes effect immediately without a restart. Not applicable on Wayland (Wayland users configure their own shortcuts externally).

The trigger string is `+`-separated: modifiers first, then the key. Modifier aliases:

| Alias(es) | Linux X11 | macOS |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `ctrl`, `control` | `Control_L` | `⌃ Control` |
| `shift` | `Shift_L` | `⇧ Shift` |
| `alt`, `option` | Mod1 (`Alt_L`) | `⌥ Option` |
| `cmd`, `command`, `super`, `meta` | Mod4 (`Super_L`) | `⌘ Command` |

**Examples:**
```yaml
trigger: "ctrl+shift+space"   # default Linux
trigger: "cmd+shift+space"    # default macOS
trigger: "alt+shift+f2"       # any platform
trigger: "super+space"        # Linux (Super/Windows key)
```

> **Note:** Hotkey changes made in the Settings window take effect immediately — no restart is required.

### Injection Settings
```yaml
injection:
  method: "keyboard"
```

### Environment Variables

All configuration values can be overridden using environment variables prefixed with `SUSSURRO_`. Nested keys are separated by underscores.

Example:
```bash
export SUSSURRO_APP_DEBUG=true
export SUSSURRO_MODELS_LLM_THREADS=8
./sussurro
```
